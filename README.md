**HOW TO USE?**

CAUTION: You cannot use mouse, trackpad and keyboard to interact with this application. Read the instruction before using it (or you will mess it up).

- Run code and you will see method selection with 2 options: Hand and Face. Notice the right corner button, which you could use it to change the language (only Vietnamese and English)!
- Don't raise your hand in front of your webcam yet!
- Do an "OK hand sign". Than separate your thumb finger and index finger. Like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPPFMCJD9ctG1gGwp-v8k4NX_RA4tYpj/view?usp=sharing
- Now raise your hand in front of the webcam. Remember to always keep your thumb and index parallel with your webcam (like the picture in the link above).
- Now move your hand to MOVE the cursor on the app. Touch your thumb and index once (as the "OK hand sign") to CLICK.
- Select your language and your method to interact, then you will get to the main menu!

If you select face:
- Move and keep your head parallel with the webcam to MOVE the cursor.
- Open your mouth once to CLICK.

If you select hand: interact as intructed above.
