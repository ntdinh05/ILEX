**ABOUT**

Hi there. Welcome to my project! This Computer Vision application in Python offering interactive learning experience (based on Vietnam's curriculum) for elementary school students and enhancing computer accessibility for students with hand disabilities.

I did this project with @DPhuoc since I was in grade 11th in high school. Our work began in Sep 2021 ended in March 2022. We won awards at 3 national contests for research and technology solutions for students in Vietnam and was recognized on Vietnam’s well-known news sites.

CAUTION: You cannot use mouse, trackpad and keyboard to interact with this application. Read the instruction before using it (or you will mess it up).

- Don't raise your hand in front of your webcam yet!
- Do an "OK hand sign". Than separate your thumb finger and index finger. Like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPPFMCJD9ctG1gGwp-v8k4NX_RA4tYpj/view?usp=sharing
- Now raise your hand in front of the webcam. Remember to always keep your thumb and index parallel with your webcam (like the picture in the link above).
- Now move your hand to MOVE the cursor on the app. Touch your thumb and index once (as the "OK hand sign") to CLICK.
- Select your language and your method to interact, then you will get to the main menu!

If you select face:
